# CursoEmV-deo_Hora-do-Dia

HORA DO DIA
This page is part of a sequence of five exercises done in the CURSO DE JAVA SCRIPT of the CURSO EM V√çDEO channel of Professor Gustavo Guanabara. This course was very useful to start learning how to edit CSS inside JavaScript functions.

Although simple, this course was very didactic to learn the concepts that were proposed.

This first exercise basically accesses the Date() function and associates a photo of the respective time of day to the morning, afternoon or evening.
